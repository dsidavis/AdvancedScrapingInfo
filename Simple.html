Consider the Web page
<a href="http://www.goes-r.gov/users/past-2012-01-09.html">http://www.goes-r.gov/users/past-2012-01-09.html</a>.
The data we want from this are the PDF and PPT(X) files for the presentations.
These are crawlable.  However, we can also get them easily.
<pre><code class="r">
library(XML)
u = "http://www.goes-r.gov/users/past-2012-01-09.html"
ll = getHTMLLinks(u)
urls = grep("\\.pdf|\\.pptx?", ll, value = TRUE)
</code></pre>
<pre>
 [1] "/downloads/tri-brochure.pdf"                        
 [2] "/downloads/tri-brochure.pdf"                        
 [3] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/CIMSSupdate.pptx"
 [4] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/CIMSSupdate.pdf" 
 [5] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/CIRA.pptx"       
 [6] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/CIRA.pdf"        
 [7] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/SPoRTupdate.ppt" 
 [8] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/SPoRTupdate.pdf" 
 [9] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/JPSS-update.pptx"
[10] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/JPSS-update.pdf" 
[11] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/Szykman.pptx"    
[12] "/downloads/2012-PG-All-Hands-01-09/Szykman.pdf"     
</pre>
First, let's note that these are relative to the original URL.
We can paste http://www.goes-r.gov in front of these to get the full URLs.
However, it is a better idea to use getRelativeURL():
<pre><code class="r">
urls = getRelativeURL(urls, u)
</code></pre>
This achieves the same result but is much more flexible and robust.
<p>
Secondly, note the first two. These are in one of the pull-down menus.
We can just eliminate them in this case. 
However, in other cases where we need to do this programmatically, we 
could use an XPath expression to filter these out, i.e. only extract those
<b>not</b> in an HTML &lt;select&gt; element or that are in a table
or that are not in a list item (li).
We have to look at the HTML content to find out which of these criteria is appropriate to match 
what we want.
We do this with
<pre><code class="r">
doc = htmlParse(u)
ll = unlist(getNodeSet(doc, "//a[not(ancestor::li)]/@href"))
</code></pre>
Then we again subset these for the PDF and PPT(X) files:
<pre><code class="r">
urls = grep("\\.pdf|\\.pptx?", ll, value = TRUE)
</code></pre>
For this document, we could also have used 
<pre><code class="r">
ll = unlist(getNodeSet(doc, "//a[ancestor::table]/@href"))
</code></pre>
since all the links are within a table.
