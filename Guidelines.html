Some very general organization principles to follow:
<ol>
<li> Work in small-ish groups and develop a strategy for the URL you are scraping.
<li> Get the data in whatever way is most convenient. Elegance and generality are not the important criteria here.
<li> Ask for advice, technical assistance, etc. at any time!
<li> See here for <a href="https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow">workflow and structure of the resulting data</a>
<li> Record what you do, ideally in code, so that you and others can reproduce and verify the data.
<li> Verify that the data you obtain is the same as it is on the Web site.
<li> Save/archive both the data and the HTML documents (and the related files, i.e., the JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
     Use "Save As" in your browser.
</ol>
</p>

<h2><a name="Structure">How to Structure Your Work</a></h2>
The data you collect, the code you used and metadata need to be in a particular
directory structure. 
It is described <a href="https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow/tree/master/harvesting-toolkit">here</a>,
specifically in sections 
<a href="https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow/tree/master/harvesting-toolkit#3-generate-html-json--directory">3</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow/tree/master/harvesting-toolkit#5-write-idjson-metadata-add-tools">5</a>.
